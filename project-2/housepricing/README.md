**House Prices Project**
By: Rawan  MohammedEid , Mohammed Alali , Ibrahim Alzahrani
## Overview
The Project covers:
- Data Load & Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model Instantiation & Prediction

### Problem Statment
<p style="text-align:justify"> The house price is an important part to decide whether you live in or choose another one. Many businesses have worked in this domain. Also, the house prices have been affected by many factors like foundation and lot area. The aim of this project is to develop a model to predict the house price based on the historical data provided by Kaggle. Also, the model predicts the sale prices as a submission for Kaggle Competition.</p>

### Executive Summary

<p style="text-align:justify">This project focuses on data on house prices provided by Kaggle, which provides information about the house like year built, lot area, and house style. Currently, the quality of the building house has been increased in the last years. As a result, the house price did not rely on the building quality only that makes the house price estimation harder. So, the objective of this project is to predict the house price by considering the main factors. The project conducts on the data science process (Regression).</p>
Exploratory data analysis produces the findings:
<ol>
    <li>The 1904 has the highest avgerage of lot area by 26519 ft<sup>2</sup>.</li>
    <li>The sale price and overall quality are positively correlated by 0.79 which is strong.</li>
    <li>The split level of house style has sale prices between <span>&#36;</span>100,000 and &#36;200,000.</li>
</ol>

### Conclusions and Recommendations
<p style="text-align:justify">The various of factors have a huge impact on house prices. The overall quality impact has appeared in datasets. Also, the overall quality and floor area are the top 3 important factors in the prediction. So, the house price will be increased by increasing the overall quality. The findings in the training dataset prove the previous fact since the correlation coefficient is strong positively by 0.79. The recommendations are focusing on lot, floor, garage area and frontage lot within the overall quality when buying the house. Therefore, the house prices will be more predictable without considering every single factor that might not affect the price. Those recommendations will provide a clear view of the house and how will be estimated while the developed model automates those process to save time on deciding and predicts the sale price.</p>
